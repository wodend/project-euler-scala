# Project Euler Scala

These are my personal solutions to the first 100 problems from
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) implemented in
[Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/).  I made them public for educational and
discussion purposes, not to simply provide answers. Please let me know if you
see any solutions which could be improved.

## Requirements

The software required to run sbt by example is listed below. Follow the links
for installation instructions.

- [Java Development Kit 8+](https://adoptopenjdk.net/installation.html)
- [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/download/)

## Installation

Project Euler Scala is for educational purposes. Clone the repository to browse
the code on your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wodend/project-euler-scala.git
```

## Usage

Compile the class file for the problem, and run it using scala to print the
solution. For example, print the solution to problem 1.

```bash
cd project-euler-scala
scalac solution/Problem001
scala Problem001
```
